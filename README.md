This repository is the deployed version of an OpenLayers map of the USGS Stream Gauge Network. 
This map is used in Notebook 4 of the NWM Notebooks created for the HydroLearn course on the NWM.
The map uses the following web service to display the gauges: https://mapservices.weather.noaa.gov/static/rest/services/nws_reference_maps/USGS_Stream_Gauges/MapServer
The service is self described as follows:
"USGS stream gauge locations where the National Water Model assimilates streamflow observations. 
This map service is for spatial reference and does not contain any NWM data."

On the map, clicking on a gauge yields some metadata. 
site_no indicates USGS site code and feature_id indicates a NWM reach id associated with that particular gauge. 

Map is viewable at: https://byu-hydroinformatics.github.io/csb-b1qbj7/
